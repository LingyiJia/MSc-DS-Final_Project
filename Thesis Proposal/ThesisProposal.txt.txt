  My thesis is analyses of pull-request(PR)  characteristics. It will include several characters: size of change at commit-level, Nature of PR as bug fix, test incluston of PR, Emotions surrounding a PR and Continuous Integration of a PR.
   In order to analyse these characteristics, it will use some columns in the dataset. Firstly some of data will be processed like normalisation and vectorization. After that, a spectrum of characters can be spanned. And I can calculate the similarity between columns. At the same time, several columns can be combined together as one character and compare with other characters. As a result, I can figure out the relationship between characters and PR acceptance.
